<div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know if it means something, but I find quite significant that I get back
to this blog again today. I like to think I&#8217;m starting from where I stopped.</p>

<!-- More -->


<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/567/20732780472_c73497060d_o.jpg"></p>

<p>Today I finally did it. It took me one year, but I found the chance, the time, the
courage - all at once - to come see you. I didn&#8217;t even know where you were, but
something was telling me I would have found you. It didn&#8217;t take long.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting anything different: no name, no dates, no monuments, no
celebration; just few signs revealing the silent transit of a loving hand. I
picked up that glass with the flowers, their pose was giving the place an atmosphere
of neglect; I hope you don&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p>I like the place; the river, the low bank, the weeping willows bending under the
breeze. It&#8217;s so beautiful and peaceful and unreal it feels like being projected
inside a children&#8217;s dream.<br/>
It might sound incredible, but so far it&#8217;s the place that reminds me of my
hometown the most here around: the post-industrial landscape, the glare of the sun in the water,
the boats, that peculiar smell of river the wind brings to the nose from time
to time. I felt like a small Proust eating his madeleine.<br/>
For some reason seeing a hornet buzzing around a yellow flower, finding a spider
patiently building its architectural prodigy across the stems, spotting
all those small insects finding a shelter in between the wild grasses - all of
this let me think you might have finally made peace with the universe.</p>

<p>But, as someone once told me, the pain is on those who remain. And I feel mine
still holds strong. Sometimes I wish I could feel it more, I wish I could just
explode and let my heart break in a million pieces, and fall down till the
bottom of the abyss, just to conquer the right to put the shards back
together again. But my body (my mind? Is there any difference?) doesn&#8217;t want to
open that gate; I&#8217;m condemned to face and come to terms with the guilt, that
feeling that I could have tried, said, done more. That feeling that it
could have been different if only I wouldn&#8217;t have been so blind in my
selfishness. God, I&#8217;m selfish even while writing these words, wishing you were
here just because I miss you so much, every word, every smile, every single
second we spent together.</p>

<p>Yet, I got to accept the choice you made. Thinking back to this past year, I
can&#8217;t stop wondering about all the &#8220;friends&#8221; that turned their back to me.<br/>
Of all of them, you have
been the most sincere, and probably the only one that deserves to be called like
that. You didn&#8217;t put on your face a patronising mask, you didn&#8217;t come up with
excuses, you didn&#8217;t let time and space pull us apart, you didn&#8217;t make me feel
you preferred somebody else, you didn&#8217;t make me feel ignored. Sadly enough, the fate
sometimes draws paradoxical plots and of all of them you&#8217;re the only one I
lost. It&#8217;s sad to be reminded of this in the very moment you&#8217;d just need someone to
talk to, realizing there&#8217;s literally no one you&#8217;d call without fearing to be
refused.</p>

<p>Luckily, though, I&#8217;m not completely alone. I&#8217;m blessed to have met on my way
somebody capable of showing me her love in the only way I find significant: not
with flattery, not with words, not with epic proofs, but rather with small everyday
signs.<br/>
I&#8217;m starting to see some sparks of light, some moments of serenity that
make me wonder things might get better.<br/>
She might even succeed in rescuing me from this darkness that seems to live deep
inside me; I need to believe that.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still hard though; and it gets harder to get along with all those daily
battles one is supposed to fight. The moment I get down the carousel to put order
in my thoughts and frame things into perspective, it appears painfully clear how
insignificant and lousy all of this is: fighting for what? Fighting for who?
Fighting to get where? And even if you get there, what does that change?
The only convincing answer I seem to have found so far is: nothing.<br/>
And I know I shouldn&#8217;t, but I can&#8217;t help myself but think how much I wasted
my life so far; all the things I haven&#8217;t done, all the moments I forcibly
prevented myself to experience, all the crazy things I avoided because &#8220;that&#8217;s
not how a person should behave&#8221;. I know I can&#8217;t get this back; time doesn&#8217;t
offer second chances. I hate myself for this, and because of the cage I managed
to trap myself into. I&#8217;m trying to break those bars, trying to find my way out
of it, but sometimes I feel I just don&#8217;t have the energy to face the endeavour.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t know how to close this letter; on one side it feels like another
farewell. On the other side though, I know this isn&#8217;t: I won&#8217;t forget, I won&#8217;t
let you into oblivion. I know you&#8217;re somewhere up there, and I know from time to
time you get my back. Now I know where to bring flowers to to say thank you.</p>

<p>If this was real life, this would be the time for a hug. But the fate decided
all we can have is just the memory of one. I&#8217;ll hold it strong, and I&#8217;ll keep it
in that special place where heart-warming feelings belong. May I never forget.</p>
