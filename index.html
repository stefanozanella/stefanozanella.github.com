  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here I am again. Floating in that limbo that fills the gap between a flight and
its next connection. I&#8217;ve done this before, it&#8217;s just another sink in which
time, people and thoughts intersect and flow like waters in an oceanic current.
It shouldn&#8217;t matter, I&#8217;m so tired that it cannot possibly matter. Though, I
feel this time is different.
This time this not-being in a non-place waiting
for being injected again in the circuits of life is full of a new tension,
something like a warm breath pushing me forward while lifting my weights, like
a pervasive magnetic field gently orienting sensitive matter toward a common
direction, meeting no resistance.
This time, yes, this precise and only time, I feel like I&#8217;m heading home.</p>

<p>I started to write this post on 24th May, 2014, while waiting for a connecting flight from
Madrid to Berlin, after three long weeks between Bilbao and Santander, Spain. I
went there to attend a course on web application security sponsored by the EU,
something I was looking forward to since the previous October. Yet, the weeks
have been extremely long, and for what I think was the first time I felt sick of
being away from the place where I live.</p>

<p>The reason why this time was different is because something happened, something I&#8217;ve been seeking constantly for at least the past
8 years, something that gave my life that spark, that tiny ray of light that breaks into the dark
before the full gloom comes: I moved to Berlin.</p>

<p>Almost one year after that sunny day of March when
I took my car, my few clothes and headed straight North for twelve hours, I find
myself thinking back at what happened and how my life changed. It&#8217;s been an
intense year, yet I&#8217;m still waiting for that moment of clarity when I&#8217;ll deeply
realize the impact of the change I made, when I&#8217;ll be able to fully embrace the
abyss standing in between the past self and the current self. Maybe it will happen
at some point, but I&#8217;m starting to believe that it won&#8217;t. Maybe it&#8217;s another
sign that what I did was the right thing at the right time, feeling so natural
that my mind doesn&#8217;t try to refuse the idea, but rather keeps deleting old
memories.</p>

<p>Thinking back at the stream of events, I feel like I should have been torn apart
by my same feelings right now. I&#8217;ve been through bright highs, and I&#8217;ve been
through dark lows, multiple times.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found myself smiling; I mean, not laughing, not reacting to a comical
situation. Smiling as in being filled by positive feelings, smiling as when you
recall a nice moment you&#8217;ll keep and remember for the rest of your life.
Smiling as in being happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll create here a skeleton that can be useful for developing Puppet modules that
adhere to some of the basic good development practices, such as testing and
continuous integration.
Why don&#8217;t I just use <code>puppet module generate</code>, you say? Because I want to have a more
complete testing framework in place, and also have some additional
facilities for reporting on tests. Though, using Puppet&#8217;s <strong>module</strong> face isn&#8217;t
incompatible with what depicted here; you can just run it before performing the
steps that follow, ignoring the creation of module&#8217;s directories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a nice one; let me explain.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve setup a PotgreSQL host to hold all the various databases for the various
services deployed in the infrastructure. Since I know I&#8217;m not a security
expert, where I can I try to do the bare minumum needed and use SSL. This is
the case for PostgreSQL; not only, but I try hard to enforce two-way
certificate validation where possibile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this post as a sort of disclamer for the posts that will follow in
the (hopefully near) future.</p>

<p>I became a fan of documentation near three years ago. Since then, I mantained
(and am still mantaining) a sort of private wiki where I try do document
whatever I do. In some cases, this practice saved my ass: since for the moment
I don&#8217;t work in a team, I&#8217;m forced to continuously move between tasks that span
from the full Dev and Ops range. Sometimes quite some time can pass until I
need to return to a previous task to fix/improve things. This can be daunting,
since memory tends to be pretty unreliable in these cases; having a neat trace
of what I did helped me to quickly restore the archived knowledge.<br/>
Over time, documenting <strong>while</strong> doing has become almost a natural practice for
me, at least for what concerns operations tasks.</p>

<p>As stated above, till now I kept this documentation almost private, just
visible to interested friends that wanted to dig from time to time into what I
did; now I feel this practice has to change.<br/>
So, I decided to at least try to make my efforts public. I&#8217;m sure there won&#8217;t
be crowds of developers or sysadmins waiting for my next post; I&#8217;m not doing it
for this reason. I&#8217;ll just try to use the lever that is what in my opinion is
the biggest benfit of open source culture: it forces you to be better at what
you do.</p>

<p>So, this little detour over my recent history just to say one basic thing: I&#8217;m
gonna store here almost everything. So, expect to find obvious things as well
as not-so-obvious ones; actually, I suspect the former will overweight the latter
at least for the moment :)</p>

<p>Having clarified this basic concept, let&#8217;s see what the sudden future reserves:
I&#8217;m gonna talk a lot in the following months about my efforts to automate the
infrastructure I&#8217;m actually managing. This effort started slightly more than a
year ago when I discovered the excellent <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">&#8220;Continuous Delivery&#8221; book</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a> and David Farley.
Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve done a lot to try to add some solid
ground on the infrastructure while maintaining the existent. I now reached a
point in which I can start to implement all those nice automation practices.<br/>
I&#8217;ll try to convert documentation I&#8217;ve already written into something suitable
for the public audience; but, since I don&#8217;t want to start yak shaving right
from the beginning, I&#8217;ll try to stay pragmatic enough and start by writing
currently on-air tasks. For this reason, I apologize in advance if some pieces
will miss from what I&#8217;ll write.</p>

<p>I force myself now to stop adding to this post; enough self-centered writing
for my tastes. Better to start writing something more practical; I&#8217;ll start
with something very very basic and in very very little DevOps style: installing
a Puppet master node.</p>
