  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Disclamer</strong>: this post is about feelings, and it&#8217;s written by me, so don&#8217;t
expect things to make much sense from now on. It might also be long, and I apologise in
advance for that.</p>

<p>This post started as a way to thank everybody I met at eurucamp last month in
Berlin, as I felt that a tweet wasn&#8217;t enough, but it turned out to be the most
difficult piece I&#8217;ve ever written.<br/>
It took me more than a month, and it&#8217;s just now, here on a plane flying back from Hamburg
after an amazing first So Coded conf, that I&#8217;m trying to put some final words on it.</p>

<p>It turns out that these words took a long time to be written down because of
the impact that those ten days in Berlin have had on my life. This impact
still provokes me tears as soon as I start reflecting on it; having a deadline
like a plane landing seems like the only way for me to call it a day for this
post.</p>

<p>eurucamp hasn&#8217;t just been another Ruby conference. It has been a thrilling,
exhausting, emotionally dense week built around the city and the people, a week
that transformed me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not exaggerating saying that eurucamp turned me into a better person. I&#8217;m not talking
about technical skills or general knowledge or curiosity satisfaction; I&#8217;m talking about maturity and
self-consciousness as a human being. The more I reflect on it and the more I
talk about it, the more I&#8217;m sure the change eurucamp operated on me is a
permanent one, and one that will have a radical impact on my future self.<br/>
I think this is pretty astonishing, given that it all started just as an opportunity
to fill the gap left by a cancelled vacation on the lake of Kontanz back at the
end of July. I was just looking to relax, and I couldn&#8217;t be more wrong
expecting just that.</p>

<p>The biggest change happened in me is the balance between the things that
matters in my life. To me, this change is kinda unbelievable. I used to
believe I was a totally uninteresting person, that people couldn&#8217;t enjoy
spending their time with me, that I had nothing interesting to say, and so on.
So, in the end this feeling drove me to a fairly solitary road, with
sparse and occasional relationships, always facing the fear of being/looking
inadequate to other human beings. This resulted in me caring more about other,
more material aspects of life and basing many decisions on that kind of focus.<br/>
A week in Berlin, deeply surrounded by the Ruby community,
completely faded that fog of irrational fear and totally revolutionized my
inner list of life priorities.</p>

<p>I recognize now that what I want from life is being as friendliest as possible
to other people and enjoying everything that I can have in return. It is my
firm belief now, that as soon as you give a smile to someone and do your best
to be as open, friendly and respectful as possible, whatever comes back in return -
being it an opinion, a suggestion, a story, a hug or whatever - is to be
treated like a little treasure, something to safely store in your mind and take
care for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Another realization I had, also, is that even if you get nothing in return (which is,
by the way, a very rare occurrence), there&#8217;s nothing to worry about. Maybe you
can use that as an opportunity to improve yourself, but if you&#8217;re not lying to
yourself and you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve done the best you could to communicate with
someone else, there&#8217;s nothing to regret. <em>Just do your best effort</em>.</p>

<p>To me, this is a liberating realization, as it makes the fog of my social
fears fade away and puts back a smile on my face. And guess what? This in turn
becomes a positive loop, since as I already said it&#8217;s quite hard to get actually
<em>nothing</em> in return from people. It&#8217;s up to you to figure out what the outcome
of a human contact is; sometimes it&#8217;s obvious, sometimes it may require time
and additional experiences for that to become clear. To an extent, also, it&#8217;s up to you
to decide <em>what to keep</em> from a human relationship.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is due to the people I met and spent time with there.
I would like to thank all of them (but I also know that I&#8217;m going to forget
someone, so please forgive me in advance).<br/>
I cannot avoid to start by mentioning
the staff of organizers. Without their continuous efforts to make such an
amazing conference, there would have been no ground for this change to happen
in me. Also, I think we all must thank them for the &#8220;vision&#8221; they had about a
<em>different</em> conference, one in which the focus was on making space for people to
interconnect - something that seems usually to be taken for granted or expected
to spontaneously happen. Believe me, that&#8217;s not so obvious, and the fact they reserved
time for people to (almost) self-organize (which also means that everybody
could choose <em>where</em> to do <em>what</em>), before and during the conference,
changed the perspective of the whole week.
So, many many thanks to Dajana, Alex, Florian, Guillermo, Fanny, Lucas, Josè,
Mari - and a huge sorry to all who I&#8217;m forgetting or didn&#8217;t know about, this
thank is for you too!</p>

<p>I also want to thank Ellen for the patience of listening to my rusty spoken English
while trying to improve my 3-years-old-toddler German.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Joanne for the conversation in the first place, but most
importantly for the most gratuitous and warmly-feeling hug I&#8217;ve received ever.</p>

<p>Another important &#8220;thank you&#8221; to Justine, Jano and Darío. As every
photographer knows, no matter if hobbist or experienced, what we seek as
photographers is a chance to take the photo that nobody has taken yet. You gave
me that opportunity, and that matters to me. A lot.</p>

<p>A huge (you cannot imagine how HUGE) thank to my friend (can I say so?)
Ernesto, who is like the brother everyone would like to have. Thanks for the
stories, the patience, the nice words, the friendliness, the open hands.</p>

<p>Another huge thank to George, who not only contributed to the list of
encouraging stories I&#8217;ve collected during the week, but also revealed itself to
be a very nice and pleasant person. The day we spent together walking around
Berlin was awesome, and I&#8217;m even more grateful for this given we just exchanged
a couple of tweets and mails without knowing each other in person. To me, this
has been a revealing experience on how powerful and beneficial ignoring your
fears can be.
The only regret I have is that I missed to say a proper goodbye; I count that
as a promise to meet soon around London ;-)</p>

<p>I also have to thank everyone who shared her story with me. In no
particular order, and probably with many omissions: Fanny, Carmen, Carmen and
his husband Enrique, Jano, José, Darìo, Sebastian, Irene and Josh.</p>

<p>And finally, my most important thank goes to Julia. She knows why.</p>

<p>PS: If anyone finds the piece of heart I left in Berlin, please don&#8217;t touch it.
I&#8217;ll come back to pick it up later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll create here a skeleton that can be useful for developing Puppet modules that
adhere to some of the basic good development practices, such as testing and
continuous integration.
Why don&#8217;t I just use <code>puppet module generate</code>, you say? Because I want to have a more
complete testing framework in place, and also have some additional
facilities for reporting on tests. Though, using Puppet&#8217;s <strong>module</strong> face isn&#8217;t
incompatible with what depicted here; you can just run it before performing the
steps that follow, ignoring the creation of module&#8217;s directories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was a nice one; let me explain.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve setup a PotgreSQL host to hold all the various databases for the various
services deployed in the infrastructure. Since I know I&#8217;m not a security
expert, where I can I try to do the bare minumum needed and use SSL. This is
the case for PostgreSQL; not only, but I try hard to enforce two-way
certificate validation where possibile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this post as a sort of disclamer for the posts that will follow in
the (hopefully near) future.</p>

<p>I became a fan of documentation near three years ago. Since then, I mantained
(and am still mantaining) a sort of private wiki where I try do document
whatever I do. In some cases, this practice saved my ass: since for the moment
I don&#8217;t work in a team, I&#8217;m forced to continuously move between tasks that span
from the full Dev and Ops range. Sometimes quite some time can pass until I
need to return to a previous task to fix/improve things. This can be daunting,
since memory tends to be pretty unreliable in these cases; having a neat trace
of what I did helped me to quickly restore the archived knowledge.<br/>
Over time, documenting <strong>while</strong> doing has become almost a natural practice for
me, at least for what concerns operations tasks.</p>

<p>As stated above, till now I kept this documentation almost private, just
visible to interested friends that wanted to dig from time to time into what I
did; now I feel this practice has to change.<br/>
So, I decided to at least try to make my efforts public. I&#8217;m sure there won&#8217;t
be crowds of developers or sysadmins waiting for my next post; I&#8217;m not doing it
for this reason. I&#8217;ll just try to use the lever that is what in my opinion is
the biggest benfit of open source culture: it forces you to be better at what
you do.</p>

<p>So, this little detour over my recent history just to say one basic thing: I&#8217;m
gonna store here almost everything. So, expect to find obvious things as well
as not-so-obvious ones; actually, I suspect the former will overweight the latter
at least for the moment :)</p>

<p>Having clarified this basic concept, let&#8217;s see what the sudden future reserves:
I&#8217;m gonna talk a lot in the following months about my efforts to automate the
infrastructure I&#8217;m actually managing. This effort started slightly more than a
year ago when I discovered the excellent <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">&#8220;Continuous Delivery&#8221; book</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a> and David Farley.
Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve done a lot to try to add some solid
ground on the infrastructure while maintaining the existent. I now reached a
point in which I can start to implement all those nice automation practices.<br/>
I&#8217;ll try to convert documentation I&#8217;ve already written into something suitable
for the public audience; but, since I don&#8217;t want to start yak shaving right
from the beginning, I&#8217;ll try to stay pragmatic enough and start by writing
currently on-air tasks. For this reason, I apologize in advance if some pieces
will miss from what I&#8217;ll write.</p>

<p>I force myself now to stop adding to this post; enough self-centered writing
for my tastes. Better to start writing something more practical; I&#8217;ll start
with something very very basic and in very very little DevOps style: installing
a Puppet master node.</p>
